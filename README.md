# AtliQ-Mart-Supply-Chain-Analysis

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

I build Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and optimize AtliQ Mart’s Supply Chain Performance! 🚀

This project was a deep dive into data-driven decision-making, helping to uncover bottlenecks, service issues, and key performance trends.

# 📌 Key Insights from the Dashboard:

## ✅ City-Level Performance Differences:

Surat has the highest OT% (61.2%), while Ahmedabad and Vadodara lag behind.
OTIF% remains consistently low across all cities, signaling widespread logistics issues.

## ✅ Customer & Product Insights:

Some high-value customers (large order volumes) receive poor service.
Products with high demand (e.g., AM Tea, AM Biscuits) show strong LIFR% and VOFR%, meaning they are being supplied efficiently.
ADDD (Average Days to Deliver) varies by product, indicating delivery inefficiencies in some categories.

## ✅ Customer Order Volume vs. Service Performance:

Some top-ordering customers (e.g., Lotus Mart, Acclaimed Stores) experience lower service levels.
This insight can help prioritize service improvements for high-value clients to reduce churn.

## 🛠 What I Implemented in This Power BI Dashboard:

 * 🔹 Interactive Visuals & KPIs – Designed dynamic performance cards to track OT%, IF%, OTIF%, LIFR%, and VOFR% in real time.
 * 🔹 City-Level Breakdown – Used bar charts to compare performance across Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara.
 * 🔹 Scatter Plot Analysis – Built a Customer Order Volume vs. Service Performance scatter chart to correlate order quantity with service levels.

## 📖 What I Learned from This Power BI Project:

 * 🎯 Data Transformation in Power Query – Cleaned and prepared raw supply chain data for analysis.
 * 🎯 DAX Measures & Calculations – Used advanced DAX formulas for LIFR%, VOFR%, ADDD, and Performance Gaps.
 * 🎯 Bookmark Navigation & Dynamic Visuals – Implemented button-based visual switching for an interactive experience.
 * 🎯 Business Storytelling with Data – Translated complex data into actionable insights for supply chain optimization.

## 🔍 Business Impact & Next Steps:

 🔸 Reduce Order Delays by identifying and resolving supply chain inefficiencies.
 🔸 Improve Supplier Performance by tracking which suppliers contribute to lower IF% & OTIF%.
 🔸 Enhance Customer Retention by prioritizing service for top-ordering clients facing service issues.
